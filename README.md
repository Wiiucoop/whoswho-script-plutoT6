# whoswho-script-plutoT6
This script creates a custom perk machine(quick revive model) in every map excluding DieRise and MOTD. These perk machines give you the who's who perk and it works just like the original does, but with altered screen effects and sound(Since I wasn't able to load the actual ones from dierise into other maps).
